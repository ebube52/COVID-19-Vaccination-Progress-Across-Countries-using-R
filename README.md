COVID-19 Vaccination Progress Across Countries using R

COVID-19 Vaccination Progress Across Countries For this analysis, I have chosen a dataset containing information on COVID-19 vaccination progress across various countries. The dataset includes data on the number of doses administered per 100 people, total doses administered, percentage of population vaccinated, and percentage of population fully vaccinated for each country.

The dataset is crucial in understanding the global efforts to combat the COVID-19 pandemic through vaccination. It provides insights into which countries have made significant progress in vaccinating their populations and which countries may need more support or resources to improve their vaccination rates.
